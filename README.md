# DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This is a group project for one of my courses in university, since I don't own the repository during the development but I want to publish it on my github, so I clone it from my friend's repository.

# Adventure Time: Quest of Memories

is a game with a fantasy quest genre. This game is a sequel to our last game from the UTS. This game will follow with you being the hero of the story. Your journey ends with the defeat of the Demon King. You return to your usual sweet home. But even so, it feels empty. A part of your life has fallen into the darkness along with the restless journey. And so you begin another adventure of your life to collect pieces of your broken life.

The game will start with you having just gotten home from the war with the Demon King. You found a weird-looking mirror at your home and it is broken. The mirror reflects your broken life after the war, and to fix it you need to collect four shards. Your choices and stats in the game matter to do that. While the goal is to collect the shards, don’t forget to enjoy the game too and make yourself happy and fulfilled.

# Game Mechanics:

- Pick your character and enter your name. Click start to enter the game
- You will be summoned outside the treehouse first of all
- You can move using your arrow keyboards or the arrow on the screen. To attack, you need to press the spacebar.
- On mobile, you can press the arrow button on screen and to attack, you need to press the attack button on the left.
- The game will start with all stats in 70% and it will decrease 2% each 10 minutes in game.
- Your stats can also increase or decrease if you do activities in certain places, such as eating or sleeping.
- You will also have 100 coins at the start of the game.
- With coins, you can buy stuff such as food or items that can be useful for crafting later.
- There will be 5 main areas in the game: The bubblegum village, the ice kingdom, the treehouse, the bat cave, and the fire empire.
- Each area can be entered into a smaller sub area and you can do activities there.
- You can only buy things in the Trade Center (Ingredient and daily needs), Tavern (Food), and Fire Shop (Crafting and rare material)
- You can do chores, part time, or explore dungeons to earn money.
- You need to have the correct ingredient to cook and craft.
- You will also have inventory in the game. But it is empty on the start and only contains a letter for the game clue.
- Every time you pick up an item or buy an item, it will go to the inventory first. 
- Not all items are available at stores, some items are exclusive to some places only.
- Not all items can be directly used. For example: A cabbage can’t be used if it’s not cooked. Some items need to be cooked, planted, or crafted first.
- Some actions need a longer time to complete. Such as gardening needs to be 5 minutes. You can use fast forward to make it done faster.
- All activities except Praying, Eating, Shop, and Fighting Slimes will have a waiting time around 5 minutes.
- If you walk near the place or an object, you can interact with the object or enter a place.
- This is an open game world so you can explore as much as you like while doing the main quest.
- At the end of the game, a satisfaction score will be calculated based on your stats.
- If you die, you will restart from the beginning and go to the main menu. So don’t do anything too reckless.
- Lastly, Have Fun!
